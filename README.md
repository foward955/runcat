# RunCat App

- A cute running cat on your windows taskbar. Can auto fit system theme or change to dark/light theme by your self.
- If you want to use other image as animation character, you can edit `config/resource.toml` and put images in the folder. The app structure as below:

```text
- root_folder
  |__ runcat.exe
  |__ config
    |__ resource.toml
  |__ resources
    |__ folder_name
       |__ images
```

- If you have some idea, let me know.
